# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the **Millennium**, in scriptures, is called: the thousand years reign of Christ (Rev. 20:2,4-7); the dispensation of the fullness of times (Eph. 1:10); the day of the Lord (Rev. 19:11-20)- the day of the Lord is also called 'that day' many times in the prophets (Isa. 2:11; 4:1; 19:21; 24:21; 26:1; Ezek. 39:22; 48:35);...

Demons will be imprisoned in the regions of Babylon, Edom, and possibly, the abyss (Rev.18:2).
