# The Millennium
For one Thousand Years there was peace. The world loved the Jews. People loved one another. The earth had lived in peace, love, and in accordance with the Word of God.
For one Thousand Years the evil and accusing thoughts that people normally have nearly all disappeared. The thoughts people have of rebellion and stubbornness against God virtually did not exist; these should never have come into their minds.
The people were not tempted, as in all previous generations prior to the Millennium, because Satan had a seal placed upon him.
Satan's voice had not been heard in the minds of the billions or perhaps hundreds of billions of people that have now repopulated the earth.
